a chart of what collides with what

			item	bomb	player		enemy		bullet		pbullet
	item		0		0		1			0			0			0
	bomb		0		0		0			1			1			0
	player		1		0		0			1			1			0			
	enemy		0		1		1			0			0			1			
	bullet		0		1		1			0			0			0		
	pbullet		0		0		0			1			0			0			
	
	
	Thing is, collisions seem to be asymmetric.
	Nothing collides with objects of the same type, so that might explain category v mask.
